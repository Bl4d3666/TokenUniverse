# Token Universe

**Token Universe** is an advanced tool that provides a wide range of possibilities to work with access tokens. My goal is to create a useful tool that implements almost everything I know about access tokens and related topics. *And, also, to learn even more in the process.*

### This includes:
 - Different methods to obtain or create tokens:
    - Opening process/thread token;
    - Searching for opened handles;
    - Querying session token;
    - Logging on users using credentials (+ adding custom group membership);
    - Creating a fully custom token from the scratch;
    - Opening linked token;
    - Filtering tokens;
    - Duplicating tokens and handles;
 - Viewing all available information:
    - Group membership and restricting SIDs;
    - Privileges;
    - Statistics and flags;
    - Logon session info;
    - Last token modification time;
    - Which processes also have this handle;
    - and even more;
 - Editing and adjusting:
    - Adjusting groups and privileges;
    - Choosing Owner and Primary Group;
    - Lowering and raising integrity level;
    - Changing session, mandatory policy, UIAccess, Virtualization, and so on;
    - Working with security descriptor and default DACL;
 - Using tokens:
    - Creating processes;
    - Assigning as primary tokens or impersonating;
    - Sharing handles with other programs or instances of Token Universe;
 - And performing other actions like:
    - Comparing tokens;
    - Linking logon sessions to create UAC-friendly tokens;

I believe that such a program can become a very useful tool for researchers and those who want to learn more about the Windows security subsystem.
